I was 20 years old. I first went to France. [Bordeux](http://ee.france.fr/en/discover/bordeaux) , France was my first town. It had a rather large book store in the center of the town. I liked buying very cheap wine and looking out into the bay. I think Bordeaux was my favorite city in France.

>I met up with some people in Bordeaux and traveled along the coast until we flew to London. The hostel in London was full of very nice Australians. I spent about 2 weeks in London.

I took a train from london to Amsterdam. I wondered in a *daze* around Amsterdam for a few days before I went to Belgium.

>Next, I went to Germany. I traveled along the Rhine river. Germany feels much more layed back then France. I didn't really pick where I would go I just went to any old randome place that the train went and figured out things from there.
